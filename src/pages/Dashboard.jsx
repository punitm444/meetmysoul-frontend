                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Hey there, welcome aboard! ðŸ’– Youâ€™ve taken the first step towards making new friends in Mysore, and
                            weâ€™re so excited to have you with us.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Hereâ€™s the plan: once youâ€™ve registered, just sit back and relax while we gather a group. We believe
                            that the more, the merrier â€” so we wait until 30 amazing people have signed up. This way, everyone gets
                            to meet a good mix of new faces and create real connections.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            As soon as the group is ready, youâ€™ll receive an email with all the meetup details â€” the date, time,
                            and location. No need to worry about missing out, weâ€™ll keep you updated every step of the way.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In the meantime, think of it as the calm before the fun storm ðŸŒ¸. Soon enough, youâ€™ll be laughing,
                            sharing stories, and building friendships that could last a lifetime.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Thanks for being patient and trusting the process. Great things take a little time, and we promise
                            itâ€™ll be worth the wait. âœ¨
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Letâ€™s make Mysore a friendlier place â€” one weekend, one soul, one smile at a time. ðŸ’Œ
